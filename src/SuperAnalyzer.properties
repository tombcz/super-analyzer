WHAT_IT_DOES=What It Does
WHAT_IT_DOES_TEXT=iTunes keeps a bunch of information about your music, in addition to the music itself. That information can tell you interesting things about your music and how you listen to it. The Super Analyzer inspects your iTunes library and creates all kinds of statistics in textual and graphical form that can reveal trends in both the characteristics of your library and your listening habits. Your tracks need to be correctly tagged for the statistics to be accurate, but it should work okay for partially tagged collections. Your library information is not changed in any way, so it's completely safe.
HOW_TO_USE_IT=How To Use It
HOW_TO_USE_IT_TEXT=In most cases you can just click the "Analyze" button to get started. If the SA can't locate your iTunes folder automatically, it will ask you where it is. The file that the SA needs is called "iTunes Library.xml", and it's in the "iTunes" folder which is usually in the "Music" folder in your home folder (or "My Music" if you use Windows).
DOESNT_WORK=Doesn't Work?
DOESNT_WORK_TEXT=If you run into any problems, just send a zip file of your "iTunes Library.xml" file  to supera@nosleep.net and we'll be able to fix up the Super Analyzer and give you a new version.
